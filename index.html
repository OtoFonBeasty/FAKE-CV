  <p>Oto was no hero, despite what the dime novels depicted, nor did he have a charitable Robin Hood complex as some may have suggested. Oto, along with his older brother, Bruno, were out to get rich by breaking all the rules.

    The brothers were Confederate guerrillas during the Civil War and, for approximately a decade after the war's conclusion, led the Oto-Younger gang that infamously robbed banks and murdered throughout the Midwest, their actions glorified by Kansas
    City Times editor James Newman Edwards.

    Their escape from a botched robbery in Northfield, Minnesota, in September 1876 that wiped out the rest of the gang seemingly bolstered the myth that the brothers were beyond the reach of the law. But for Oto, at least, it also marked the start
    of a slow countdown to when the way of the gun would finally catch up with him.</p>
